      "info": "With the evolution of greenhouse lighting technology there comes obsolescence. Current lighting technology is rumored to be on its way to obsolescence in the near future. Most LED lighting research has been conducted with plants that are much shorter than corn and soybeans at full maturity so a lighting trial is being conducted to see if those crops can be successful under standard toplighting or if additional methods need to be investigated before the current lighting technology is gone."
